# afrilearndata

<!-- badges: start -->

<!-- badges: end -->

afrilearndata provides small African datasets to help with learning and
teaching of spatial techniques and mapping.

## Installation

Install the development version of afrilearndata with:

``` r

    # install.packages("remotes") # if not already installed
    
    remotes::install_github("afrimapr/afrilearndata")
    
    library(afrilearndata)
```

## Outline

The package contains the following objects

1.  `sfafricountries` polygons, country boundaries
2.  `sfafricontinent` polygons, continent outline including madagascar
3.  `sfafrihway` lines, trans african highway network
4.  `sfafricapitals` points, capital cities
5.  `rastafriwpop2020` raster grid, population density 2020 from
    (WorldPop)\[<https://www.worldpop.org/>\] aggregated to 20km squares
6.  `rastafriwpop2000` raster grid, population density 2000 from
    (WorldPop)\[<https://www.worldpop.org/>\] aggregated to 20km squares

Lazy loading means that the objects should be accessible once
`library(afrilearndata)` is used.

If they are not recognised you can use e.g.Â `data(sfafricountries)` to
make sure the objects are loaded.

Firstly, here are all the data shown together. The `tmap` code to create
this plot is shown later in the readme.

Now looking at the data layers individually plotted with packages `sf`
or `raster`

``` r

library(afrilearndata)
library(sf)

# polygons
plot(sf::st_geometry(sfafricountries))
```

<img src="man/figures/README-countries-1.png" width="100%" />

``` r

# lines
plot(sf::st_geometry(sfafrihway))
```

<img src="man/figures/README-highway-1.png" width="100%" />

``` r

# points
plot(sf::st_geometry(sfafricapitals))
```

Population density data are from WorldPop clipped to Africa and
aggregated to 20km resolution to make them more manageable.

``` r

# raster grid
# install.packages("raster") # if not already installed
library(raster)
plot(rastafriwpop2020)
```

<img src="man/figures/README-population-grid-1.png" width="100%" />

Interactive maps can be created using the `mapview` package.

``` r

# install.packages("mapview") # if not already installed

library(mapview)
mapview::mapview(sfafricountries, zcol="name")  
  
```

Here is a repeat of the map shown at the start of the readme, together
with the code used to create it.

``` r

library(afrilearndata)

# install.packages("tmap") # if not already installed
library(tmap)

# tmap_mode("view") to set to tmap interactive viewing mode

tm_shape(rastafriwpop2020) +
    tm_raster("ppp_2020_1km_Aggregated", palette = rev(viridisLite::magma(5)), breaks=c(0,2,20,200,2000,25000)) +
    #tm_raster("ppp_2020_1km_Aggregated", palette = get_brewer_pal("BuPu", n = 7), style="fisher") + 
tm_shape(sfafricountries) +
    tm_borders("white", lwd = .5) +
    #tm_text("iso_a3", size = "AREA") +
tm_shape(sfafrihway) +
    tm_lines(col = "blue") + 
tm_shape(sfafricapitals) +
    tm_symbols(col = "black", shape=1, alpha=0.4, scale = .6 ) + #shape=1 for open circle but not in view mode
tm_legend(show = FALSE)
```
